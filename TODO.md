# Outstanding TODOs

This file tracks follow-up items that were intentionally scoped out of merged
PRs. Each entry should link to the PR that surfaced it, point at the code
involved, and describe the smallest change that closes it out.

When you finish one, delete the entry (or move it under a short "Done" log at
the bottom if the history is useful).

## Asset classifier: `"tif"` substring check can never match uppercased name

- **Surfaced in:** [PR #2](https://github.com/theminiverse/umbra-py/pull/2) ("Notes for reviewers")
- **Origin PR:** [PR #1](https://github.com/theminiverse/umbra-py/pull/1)
- **Code:** `src/umbra_py/models.py:27-29` (`_classify_asset`)

`_classify_asset` builds `name = f"{key} {asset.get('href', '')}".upper()` and
then checks `"tif" in name`. Because `name` is uppercased, the lowercase
substring `"tif"` can never match — the branch is dead code.

In practice the parallel `"geotiff" in media` check (against the lowercased
media type) catches Umbra's COGs, so no regression has been observed. But an
item that only declares `image/tiff` (no `geotiff` substring) would slip
through and never be classified as a GeoTIFF asset.

**Fix sketch:** either compare against the lowercased name
(`".tif" in name.lower()`) or use `"TIF" in name` to match the existing upper-cased
string. Add a regression test in `tests/` covering an asset whose media type is
plain `image/tiff` and whose href ends in `.tif`.

## Register `umbra-mcp` in the MCP registries and Anthropic's directory

- **Surfaced in:** the `umbra-mcp` MCP server PR (`AI_INTEGRATION_IDEAS.md` B1).
- **Code:** `src/umbra_py/mcp_server.py`, `pyproject.toml` (`[mcp]` extra,
  `umbra-mcp` console script).

The server itself is shipped and runnable (`umbra mcp` / `uvx umbra-mcp`), but
registering it in the public MCP registries and Anthropic's directory — the
discovery half of the deliverable — is still open. Follow-ons named in the B1
doc: a LangChain/LlamaIndex community tool wrapper reusing the same tool shapes,
and returning the polarization-mixing warning as structured text alongside the
`change_composite` image block.

## Done

- **Bootstrap local search from the published catalog snapshot.** Added
  `CatalogIndex.from_release()` / `umbra index fetch` (downloads the rolling
  `catalog-index` release's `catalog.db` via the resume-safe `download_url`),
  plus a `built_at` build stamp surfaced as a staleness note in
  `umbra index info`. Surfaced in
  [PR #26](https://github.com/reesehammer/umbra-py/pull/26).
