## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Multi-temporal SAR change composites** via new `change_composite` /
  `save_change_composite` functions and an `umbra change <url> <url>
  [<url>] --out change.png` CLI command. Pass 2–3 acquisitions of the
  same site (e.g. items from one Umbra task) in chronological order; the
  bands are co-registered onto a shared lon/lat grid (each cloud-optimized
  GeoTIFF is read at a downsampled resolution via HTTP range requests and
  warped so the same output pixel is the same ground location on every
  date), percentile-stretched, and assigned to color channels. Unchanged
  ground stays gray while change is tinted by *when* it happened: for two
  dates, **green** = backscatter that appeared in the later pass, **magenta**
  = backscatter that vanished; for three dates, an earliest→latest red/green/
  blue temporal-RGB. Only the area imaged on every pass is colored (pixels
  missing from any acquisition are transparent), and `--db` switches to the
  radiometrically-correct decibel stretch. This is SAR's signature change-
  detection view with no manual co-registration. Requires the `viz` extra.
  The percentile/dB stretch shared with the quicklook path was factored into
  a `_normalize_band` helper.
- **Standalone SAR quicklooks** via new `quicklook` / `save_quicklook`
  functions and an `umbra quicklook <item-url> --out scene.png` CLI
  command. This is the lowest-friction way to *see* an Umbra
  acquisition: it streams a downsampled preview of the item's
  cloud-optimized GeoTIFF via HTTP range requests (no multi-gigabyte
  download, no Folium map, no GIS) and writes a plain image whose
  format follows the output extension. The raster is read in its
  native, already-geocoded projection — a faithful look at the pixels
  rather than a map-placeable warp. Two SAR-specific rendering options:
  `--db` switches to a decibel (log-amplitude) stretch — the
  radiometrically-correct view that reveals terrain texture and urban
  structure the default linear stretch crushes toward black — and
  `--colormap NAME` (e.g. `viridis`, `magma`) pseudo-colors the result
  through any matplotlib colormap. Tunables match the map overlays:
  `--asset` (default `GEC`), `--max-size` (default 2048), `--percentile`
  (default `2,98`). Requires the `viz` extra. The `_stretch_to_rgba`
  helper grew matching `db` / `colormap` parameters, and the rasterio
  read shared with `image_overlay` was factored into `_read_sar_band`.
- **Browser-side lazy SAR imagery** via a new `lazy_imagery=True` kwarg
  on `footprint_map` and `timeline_map`, plus a matching
  `umbra map --lazy-imagery` CLI flag. Each popup gets a "Get SAR
  image" button; on click, the page lazily loads
  [`geotiff.js`](https://geotiffjs.github.io/) (from a pinned CDN),
  streams a low-resolution overview of the GEC cloud-optimized GeoTIFF
  directly from the Umbra public bucket via HTTP range requests,
  applies the same percentile-and-transparent-invalid-pixels stretch
  Python's `_stretch_to_rgba` uses, and drops it on the map as a plain
  Leaflet `L.imageOverlay` placed at the item's footprint. Second
  click removes it. A 200-item map weighs ~30 KB regardless of how
  many items it carries — users only pay the fetch cost for items they
  actually open. Works with `--timeline` (scrub to a moment, click the
  polygon, see the actual SAR), and is mutually exclusive with the
  pre-baked `--imagery` overlay path. Tunables: `lazy_imagery_asset`
  (default `"GEC"`), `lazy_imagery_percentile` (default `(2.0, 98.0)`).

  Decoding runs on the main thread (no Web Workers), so the saved HTML
  works whether opened over http(s) **or** straight off disk
  (`file://`). Placement stretches the geocoded raster onto its
  lat/lon footprint bbox rather than reprojecting — a quick-look
  approximation; use `imagery=True` for a pixel-accurate, GDAL-
  reprojected overlay.


- `umbra_py.timeline_map` / `save_timeline_map` and a matching `umbra
  map --timeline` CLI flag: render search results as a
  TimestampedGeoJson layer so Umbra's coverage accumulates beneath a
  play button + slider. Each footprint surfaces at its acquisition
  timestamp and keeps the same metadata popup as `footprint_map`.
  Tunables: `period` (slider step, ISO 8601 — `"PT1H"`/`"P1D"`/`"P7D"`
  match a day's / month's / year's search density), `duration` (how
  long each footprint stays visible — `None` accumulates, an ISO
  duration fades it back out), `auto_play`, `loop`, `transition_time`,
  and `geocode` / `geocode_zoom` (same Nominatim reverse-geocoding
  behavior as `footprint_map` — the resolved place name is baked into
  the popup before it ships into the TimestampedGeoJson payload, since
  the plugin renders properties verbatim). The CLI's existing
  `--geocode/--no-geocode` flag now flows through to `--timeline` too.
  `--timeline` is still rejected with `--imagery` (animating base64
  SAR rasters across the slider is a separate, larger lift) or with
  non-HTML output extensions.
- `UmbraCatalog.search(max_per_task=N)` (and `--max-per-task N` on `umbra
  search` / `umbra map`): cap how many items are yielded from any one
  `sar-data/tasks/<task>/` directory. Each task is repeated imaging of
  the same area, so `--max-per-task 1` swaps the usual "every revisit of
  a few sites" output for "one acquisition per distinct site" — much
  better diversity on a map.
- `umbra map --imagery-max-size N` to control how big each SAR overlay
  is read at. Default stays 1024 (modest HTML size); bump to 2048 or
  4096 for sharper overlays at quadratically larger filesizes. Useful
  when you want to zoom in on a single acquisition; remember SAR is
  inherently speckled, so higher resolutions also reveal more noise.
- A small 3-line satellite-orbit animation runs on stderr during
  `umbra map` and `umbra search` to show the catalog walk is making
  progress. Auto-suppressed when stderr isn't a TTY (CI, piped output)
  so captured logs stay clean.

### Fixed
- `UmbraItem.asset_href` now resolves a public, fetchable HTTPS URL for
  items built directly from a published STAC sidecar (i.e. `umbra info`,
  `umbra download`, `umbra quicklook`, or `UmbraItem.from_dict(get_json(url))`).
  Umbra's `*.stac.v2.json` sidecars list asset hrefs as `s3://` URLs into a
  *private* processing bucket; the old code returned those verbatim, so
  `rasterio`/CURL failed with `Protocol "s3" not supported` and downloads
  pointed at an inaccessible bucket. The download products actually sit next
  to the sidecar in the open bucket, so any non-HTTP(S) href is now rewritten
  to the sibling public URL relative to the item's own sidecar `href` — which
  also fixes named-task layouts (`tasks/<name>/<task_id>/<acq>/…`) where
  reconstructing from `umbra:task_id` alone produced a 404. `UmbraCatalog.search`
  was unaffected (it already rebuilt public hrefs while walking the bucket).

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `UmbraCatalog.search` now walks Umbra's live data layout
  at `sar-data/tasks/<task>/[<uuid>/]<acquisition>/` (each acquisition has
  a `*.stac.v2.json` sidecar) instead of the legacy `stac/catalog.json`
  tree. The v1 tree is mostly metadata stubs that reference data Umbra
  never published — a 60-item v1 search returned exactly one downloadable
  item. The v2 walker enumerates the actual published acquisitions, so
  every item returned has resolvable asset URLs. Date pruning still works:
  acquisition directory names start with `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS`, and the
  walker skips subtrees outside the requested `start` / `end` range.
  Provide a date range — without one the walker scans every published
  acquisition, which takes minutes.
- **Breaking:** `UmbraCatalog(root_url=...)` is gone. Configure the bucket
  via `UmbraCatalog(bucket=..., region=...)` if you ever need a non-default
  endpoint.

### Removed
- **Breaking:** `UmbraCatalog.available_task_ids()` and the
  `search(data_available_only=...)` flag, plus the matching
  `umbra search --available-only` / `umbra map --available-only` flags.
  They were stopgaps that filtered the v1 walk; the v2 walker only ever
  returns items whose data is published, so the filter is redundant.
- **Breaking:** `umbra_py.constants.DEFAULT_STAC_ROOT` (was never publicly
  re-exported).

### Added
- `umbra_py.viz` module for visualizing search results.
  - `item_to_feature`, `items_to_featurecollection`, `write_geojson`:
    convert items to GeoJSON for QGIS, leafmap, Earth Engine, geopandas,
    deck.gl, or any other tool that reads GeoJSON. The third coordinate of
    Umbra's 3D footprints is stripped so they render in 2D viewers.
  - `footprint_map`, `save_footprint_map`: build an interactive Folium map
    of one or more acquisitions, with auto-fit bounds and a metadata popup
    per item. Requires the `viz` extra.
  - `UmbraItem.to_geojson()` convenience method.
- `umbra map` CLI subcommand: search the catalog and write an interactive
  HTML map (`--out footprints.html`) or a GeoJSON FeatureCollection
  (`--out footprints.geojson`) to disk.
- `UmbraItem.asset_href` now resolves empty hrefs in recent Umbra STAC
  items. Umbra currently publishes every asset with `"href": ""` and
  expects consumers to reconstruct the URL from `umbra:task_id` and a
  rename mapping (`<base>_MM.tif` -> `<base>_GEC.tif`, etc.). Items with
  populated hrefs are returned unchanged, so older catalogs and the
  offline test fixture keep working. Unblocks live downloads and the SAR
  image overlay against 2024+ items.
- SAR image overlays on the Folium map.
  - `image_overlay(item)`: stream a downsampled preview of an item's GEC
    cloud-optimized GeoTIFF via HTTP range requests (no full download),
    apply a percentile contrast stretch to handle SAR's wide dynamic
    range, reproject to lat/lon if needed, and return a Folium
    `ImageOverlay` ready to drop onto any map.
  - `footprint_map(items, imagery=True)` / `umbra map --imagery`: one-call
    convenience that combines footprints with the SAR imagery. Each
    overlay is embedded as a base64 PNG so the resulting HTML file is
    self-contained — no tile server required.
  - The `viz` extra now also pulls in `rasterio` and `numpy` for the
    image-overlay path; folium-only users are unaffected.
  - `footprint_map(items, imagery=True)` is resilient to per-item
    failures: when one item's GEC asset is unreachable (404, network
    error, missing pixels), it emits a `UserWarning` and continues, so
    the remaining footprints and overlays still render. Umbra's public
    bucket has many STAC items whose binary data was never published,
    and the previous behavior crashed the whole map on the first one.
  - `image_overlay` now raises `AssetNotFoundError` with a clear message
    when the asset's URL can't be resolved (empty href, no
    `umbra:task_id`), instead of passing an empty URL to rasterio.
  - `footprint_map` now also draws a small always-visible circle marker
    at each footprint's centroid and a fixed-position legend in the
    top-right corner. Filled markers indicate items whose SAR imagery
    was rendered; outlined markers are footprint-only. This solves the
    "I have items, but I can't see any dots at world zoom" problem
    Umbra footprints are only a few km across.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-22

Initial release. Discovery + download core for Umbra's open SAR data.

### Added
- `UmbraCatalog`: search Umbra's static STAC catalog by bounding box, date
  range, and product type, with date-based pruning of the catalog tree so a
  constrained search only fetches relevant day catalogs.
- `UmbraItem`: lightweight dataclass over STAC items with metadata accessors
  (platform, product type, polarizations, resolution, incidence angle, …),
  bbox derivation from 3D geometry, and human-readable summaries.
- Anonymous HTTPS downloads (`download_url`, `download_asset`, `download_item`)
  with resume support and progress callbacks.
- `umbra` CLI with `search`, `info`, and `download` commands.
- Optional `convert` extra: `sicd_to_amplitude_geotiff` for inspection-quality
  amplitude extraction from SICD.
- Project scaffolding: Apache 2.0 license, packaging, CI, tests, and docs.
