# Load & xarray

Read a clipped or decimated SAR scene straight into an `xarray.DataArray`, or
write a GeoTIFF. Requires the `[load]` extra.

`to_stack` is the multi-date companion: it co-registers several acquisitions
onto one shared grid and returns a `(time, y, x)` datacube — the step
`stackstac` / `odc-stac` play elsewhere in the STAC ecosystem, which can't be
pointed at Umbra because successive passes over a site arrive in whatever UTM
zone and extent each acquisition used.
